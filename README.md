# Quri URL Shortener (CakePHP 1.3)

URL shortening platform written in CakePHP 1.3. Takes a URL, adds it to a database and gives the user a short URL with a unique hash (slug) which lets them access it later. Any traffic passing through the shortened URL is logged for end user statistics.

## Installation
1) Download the source code from the repo and extract to your web server.
2) Create the database tables from the included quri.sql file.
3) Edit app/config/core.php
	3a Change The Security.salt (Line 204) value to a random sequence of integers and characters.
	3b Change The Security.cipherSeed (Line 209) value to a random sequence of integers.
4) Edit app/config/database.php
	4b Set your database auth information as required
	
## Features
* Generates a base 16 slug for a given URL.
* Redirects to the home page if no slug is given.
* Creates a new URL row in the database for each instance of a URL so stats can remain independant.
